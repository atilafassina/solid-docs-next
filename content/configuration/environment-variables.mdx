# Setting Up Environment Variables

Solid is built on top of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which offers a convenient way to handle environment variables.
The following steps will show how to set up environment varaibles in a Solid project:

1. In the root directory of the project, create a file called `.env`.
   This file will store environment variables in the `key = value` format.

<CalloutTip>
To prevent accidental exposure of environment variables to the client, only variables prefixed with `VITE_` will be exposed.

For example:

```json
VITE_SECRET_KEY = 123hello
DB_PASSWORD = foobar
```

Only the `VITE_SECRET_KEY` will be exposed to client source code, while `DB_PASSWORD` will not, as shown below.

```jsx
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_SECRET_KEY) // 123hello
console.log(import.meta.env.DB_PASSWORD) // undefined
```

</CalloutTip>
    
2. In your Solid code, you can use <code class="text-sm">`i<wbr />mport.meta.env</code> to access your environment variables.
Vite will automatically inject the environment variables into your application.

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
	return (
		<div>
			<h2>
				Component with environment variable used{" "}
				{import.meta.env.VITE_VARIABLE_NAME}
			</h2>
		</div>
	)
}
export default MyComponent
```

For more information on environment variables in Vite and enabling TypeScript intellisense for environment variables, please refer to the [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-files).
